# Future Plans

This document describes what backwards incompatible break are planned for a next
major release. _I must clarify, that I do realize how outrageously stupid it may
sound like to plan for a breaking change befor the first initial version's 
release, but hey, there's a time pressure on my shoulder right now + MaxMind's 
"binary format" "desgined" by its script kiddos slowed things down baadly._

## Replace CIDR Strings with proper intelligence

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing)

At the time of writing I just had to port the dumbass php style "String 
representation" of networks. That's bad. That's so bad, that normally I wouldn't
permit such a crap in my company.

What I want is to create a unit (most probably it'll be a struct?) that not only
represents the network, but also provides utilities that can check whether an 
`IpAddress` belongs to that network for example. Should be representable in many 
different forms, etc.

## Error handling

There used to be an original concept of how to do proper error handling & 
exception case coverage, however due to the 3 rewrites forced by the poor "design"
of the maxmind binary format didn't leave me enough time to do it properly.
Therefore, at the time of writing whenever something goes off, you get a nil. That 
makes my enterprise originated soul cry for a whiskey. Or a p√°linka.

What I want is to design either an enum based exception case communication & 
coverage, either a thrown error based one.

# GeoIP2-swift

**HEAVILY WORK IN PROGRESS.**

Progress postponed for a few days.
In its current state it mostly works, but is unacceptably slow to initialize. 
The lookup time is fast, but it's an unacceptable speed to initialize.

Initialization performance problems root mainly from the poor DB design.

**Will revisit after 8th of July.**

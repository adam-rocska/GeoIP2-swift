# Good to know about the API module

It was intentionally designed to reproduce the php scripter fantasies, and awful 
modeling to reduce risks of having a broken library behavior, and data provision.

Depending on how widespread the library may become, the new fancy API of which 
I could be proud of will be delivered either :
* **as a backwards incompatible way**, by simply throwing it all out in the 
garbage, and providing a proper professional api
* **as a backwards compatible way**, by doing a minor release, marking this pile 
of shit I wrote as deprecated, providing a neat API module, and throwing this 
trash in the garbage in the future.
